# 28-Alphas-Later

The idea behind this mod is to slow progression, make traders less powerful, and generally extend the time for a playthrough, while keeping the vanilla look and feel.

*** FEATURES *** 

The player is permanently infected, with no cure, and the infection persists through death.

Headshots ONLY. Zombies can only be damaged/killed with headshots, or with fire, or with explosives.

Zombies DON'T bleed. Nothing undead takes bleed damage.

New basic wood arrow/bolt. Made from a single branch, its range is poor, its damage isn't great, and it always breaks on impact.

All arrows and bolts have a 25% chance of causing bleeding on a living target. Shame it doesn't work on the undead ...

The serrated blade only fits on spears and knuckles now.

New block - the beehive. Find bees (and honey) in specific tree stumps (beehives) in the world, and use them to produce honey. Normal wild tree stumps have a higher chance of giving honey too.

New dew collector. The dew collector now uses a filter WITH durability. It has to be replaced when it breaks, or the collector will stop.

New block - the chicken snare. Place this block down, and load it with corn seed to attract and trap chickens, which can be used in coops to produce eggs.

New block - the chicken coop. Place this block, add a chicken from a trap, and it will produce eggs over time.

New danger - poison. Snakes (and spider zombies)  will envenom you when they bite. Kill the snake to extract its venom, which can be used to  make antivenom.

New danger - radiation. The Wasteland biome is irradiated, and very, VERY dangerous. You'll need a hazmat suit before you venture in there.

Hazmat armour mods can be crafted from hazmat gear. You’ll still need all five mods (head, gloves, chest, legs, and boots) for full radiation protection.

Radiated zombies now irradiate the player when they attack. A full hazmat suit or a full set of hazmat mods negates this.

Hazmat zombies are a guaranteed source of hazmat gear. Kill one, and if it drops loot, it'll have some hazmat gear in there.

New zombies - Mutated. Bigger, tankier, stronger, yellower, and with more radiated regen. You'll need a blessed metal mod to take them down - the wasteland is full of these guys.

New mods - blessed metal for stopping mutated regen. NiCd is back, as is Flaming Oil and Liquid Nitrogen.

New foods - all canned food found in loot, vending machines, and trader stock is "uncooked". Cook it to make it safe to eat, or eat it and run the risk of food poisoning ...

Uncooked cans don't replenish health, just food and water.

New cooked foods - three new recipes, chicken stew, and chicken miso, top of the tier 4 food chain, and Scrambled Eggs, basic recipe, unlocked by default. Needs a cooking pot, but is a better use for eggs.

MegaCrush is craftable, in a campfire, with a beaker, and cheaper in a chemistry station.

Pies and cheesecake need honey for that sweet, sweet taste now

More zombies and biomes are gamestaged, which means they get harder as you level up.

Zombies are tougher.

Nights are dangerous, downtown is much more dangerous.

Traders are still protected, but they open from dawn 'til dusk. No more waiting for 6 am anymore.

Traders and vending machines are MUCH more expensive to buy from, and will buy from you at a much lower price.

Progression - there is no more Daring Adventurer or Better Barter. Traders will give a drink after every quest tier, which will increase bartering by 5% and trader level by one for each tier of quests completed.

Progression - there is a new perk, Survival Instinct. It's a "single-player" version of Charismatic Nature.

Resources - trees no longer give wood, they give wood logs, scraps, and branches. Logs can be placed and then chopped with an axe for wood, or use the table saw to do it quicker and better.

The tablesaw cannot be crafted, it can only be collected from POIs. Press "E" to pick one up.

Resources - primitive weapons and ammo are now made from wood scraps, branches, plant fibres, and/or stone.

The workbench now has slots for a wrench, hammer, ratchet, impact driver, and nail gun. These tools are needed to craft a lot of items, and some items have been moved from inventory crafting to workbench crafting.

Cobblestone is now more expensive to make in your inventory. Use a cement mixer to make it cheaper.

The cement mixer now requires gasoline to work.

The forge no longer requires you to smelt items. You can use the items directly from your inventory.

All vehicles EXCEPT the bicycle are too heavy for you to carry.

Concrete now requires a bucket of water and is crafted in batches of 250.

Repair kits are more expensive, and weapons/armour/tools that require specific crafting parts now require a specific repair kit.

Crafting is 25% more expensive, loot quantities are much lower, and harvesting and scrapping are 50% lower.

Bears, wolves, and direwolves are back in the forest.

Crops' growing time is double that of vanilla.

XP required to level increased by 25%.

Dismember chance lowered to 1% per attribute level, max at 10%.

Living off the Land now offers a discount to crops needed to make seeds, level 2 costs 4 crops per seed, level 3 costs 3 crops per seed.

Honey infection treatment reduced to 3% from 5%.

Knife base damage rebalanced to account for the lack of bleeding zombies.

Starter items changed. You have a backpack in slot 2 of your toolbelt, open it for food, drink, first aid and a flashlight.

Zombie health increases with game difficulty. Scavenger starts with zombies dealing 100% damage and no health bonus. Zombie health increases by 20% per level, up to 100% more health on insane difficulty. Damage received by zombies increases by 25% per level up to Survivalist, and then a further 50% jump to Insane (150% more damage dealt at maximum difficulty)
Hazmat zombies are now immune to burning.

New Frozen zombie variant. Slightly tougher, slightly slower, slightly more XP, and take slightly more damage than their “Normal” counterparts. Immune to the effects of liquid nitrogen. Found in the snow biome.

New “rotting” zombie variant. They have low HP, lower XP reward, and they take more damage. Found in the forest and desert biomes.

“Normal”, “frozen” & “rotting” ‘Fat’ zombies (Big Mama, tourist) don’t puke, but they do explode …
