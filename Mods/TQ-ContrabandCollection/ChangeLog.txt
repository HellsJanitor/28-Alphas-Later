v1.3	Fixed quitting the game (in singleplayer) during the contraband collection quest while the crate exists can cause an infinite number of console errors when re-loading the game.  
		Fixed failing the quest with the satchel in inventory did not remove the satchel
		Note that after handing in the quest (or failing the quest), there can be several seconds lag before the satchel is removed, this is by design.
